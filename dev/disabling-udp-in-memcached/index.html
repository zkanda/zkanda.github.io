<p>For us, they determined that our memcached port is open, we were confused at first how could this happen, we were sure that this is blocked via iptables.</p>

<p>It turns out memcached by default listens to both TCP and UDP, since we don&rsquo;t have <em>yet</em> a firewall for UDP, we opted for something simpler and to disable UDP on memcached(we know we only use TCP).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how to do it, add this line in <code>/etc/memcached.conf</code></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-txt" data-lang="txt"># Disable UDP
-U 0</code></pre></div>
<p>Simple fix yet effective for now.</p>
