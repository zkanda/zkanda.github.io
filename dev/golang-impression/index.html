<p>I&rsquo;ve been very excited to use <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> at work and somehow very refreshing, been meaning to learn it for some time but it&rsquo;s easier for me to learn if I actually see it in action.</p>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s been very nice, though of course, some stuff is not so easy. Here&rsquo;s one trivial matter.</p>

<ul>
<li>First using it with Python feel like I&rsquo;m lost when context switching. Our main application is written in Python/Django and we are slowly trying to build microservices around it. They communicate via thrift.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had to test a package that makes sure it truncates to a certain Unicode character limit. This is when I appreciated Python for having duck typing. I can just build a long character like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">long_unicode_char <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ひ&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">*</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For some reason, my brain is fixated on how easy it is to do in a dynamic language that it blocks from trying to search for a way in Go. But then of course, after some complaining and brain rewire you can then move forward.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s how you should it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-go" data-lang="go"><span style="color:#a6e22e">s</span> <span style="color:#f92672">:=</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">strings</span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">Repeat</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;ひ&#34;</span>, <span style="color:#ae81ff">100</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Small things matters.</p>

<h4 id="contributing">Contributing</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tried contributing to the ecosystem, so far I&rsquo;m interested in <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a>, the new and hopefully will become the official package management. The people who manage it seems to be very nice. And for some interesting reason, it&rsquo;s one of the projects that have active woman contributors, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot, but it&rsquo;s kind of just refreshing thought.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="dislike">Dislike</h4>

<ul>
<li>One inherit things that I don&rsquo;t like is how common it is to declare single character variable, you see this a lot in examples given in the official blog post. I see this mostly in c code but I guess I just have to get used to that.</li>
</ul>
