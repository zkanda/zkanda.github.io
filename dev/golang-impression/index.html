I can just build a long character like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-python data-lang=python>long_unicode_char <span style=color:#f92672>=</span> <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;ひ&#34;</span> <span style=color:#f92672>*</span> <span style=color:#ae81ff>100</span>

The people who manage it seems to be very nice. And for some interesting reason, it&rsquo;s one of the projects that have active woman contributors, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot, but it&rsquo;s kind of just refreshing thought.</li></ul><h4 id=dislike>Dislike</h4><ul><li>One inherit things that I don&rsquo;t like is how common it is to declare single character variable, you see this a lot in examples given in the official blog post. I see this mostly in c code but I guess I just have to get used to that.</li></ul></article><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>posts</a>
