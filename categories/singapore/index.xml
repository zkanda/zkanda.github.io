      <description>This is first time attending a conference outside my country. It was pretty exciting and scary because I&amp;rsquo;m going alone but nonetheless it was an amazing experience.
I met a couple of interesting people and mostly I think it boost more my confidence in travelling.
The first day was all about learning Go for Intermediate developers by William Kennedy.
I learned quite a lot, although I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Go in work for some time now, I admit that I still have a long way to go.</description>
