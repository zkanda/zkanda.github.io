      <description>So I upgraded my Windows partition to latest insider preview and it kind of messed up my laptop.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the error message:
EFI stub: ERROR: failed to read file. Trying to load files to higher address EFI stub: ERROR: failed to read file.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the step I did to resolved it.
 Boot in an ArchLinux liveusb. Mount your root and boot partition. Chroot into it. And reinstall the bootloader.</description>

      <description>You have a new laptop, you install ArchLinux on it and seems like some things are missing. This is currently the case for me:
 one missing feature was suspend, my laptop just seems to boot as if I turned off everything, my application is not persisted another is a fix for my headphone noise issue, just to name a few&amp;hellip;  One of the few things you can try is to install the latest beta kernel.</description>
