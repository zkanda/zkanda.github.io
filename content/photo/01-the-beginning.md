What does it take to be inspired? To feel connected with what you're doing?

This is what photography is for me, or maybe more than that.

There was a time where I worked a lot, not smartly but hardly. It was a moment happiness, a state of flow. But at some 
point, I felt like this was the only thing that's happening in my life, it was fun, but I couldn't get out the feeling
of uneasiness, an intuition of doing something. I tried many things, and in a way, photography is the one that clicked
with me. The act of taking photo satisfies my other curiosity. Maybe you could call it my desire for art, but in a way,
my professional work is, in my opinion, is a form of art too. In any case, doing photography and programming is very
beneficial for me.

What I was thinking is to add some sort of stories between photos. But it might be something else.

The goal would be to showcase, inspiration and tell a story.
