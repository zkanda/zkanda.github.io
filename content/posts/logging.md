It has been a decade since I've worked professionally as a software developer.

This is my reflection on what I think of a good practice for logging.

What should and what shouldn't be.

In the beggining, the only log I know is the application log. Nowadays, you'll find mostly 3 different kind.

* Application
* Metrics
* Tracing

## Here are some guidelines I follow whenever I decide to log certain things or not.

### What should go to Application?

### What should go to Metrics?

### What should go to Tracing?
