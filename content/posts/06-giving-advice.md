Recently, I've come to ask myself, how do I deal with situation when my reaction is to want to give advice to the person I'm talking with. 

My intention especially in this moment to help but most of the time what I'm seems to make the person even further away than where I'd like them to be.

Then I talk to a friend of mine, she said a good life coach doesn't give you advice, they ask the right question.

My goal is not to be a life coach, but to be able to help a friend effectively.

This article is my brain dump on where I'am currently on that journey.

## Mindfulness

The first thing I worked at is how to be aware of my tendencies and behavior.
For example, when a friend is describing their current problems, I immediately felt some tension in stomach and couldn't wait to give him/her, to the best of my knowledge that optimal solution to that problem.

In my experience, this is the hardest to accomplish, every now and then, I still do this. It amazed me how our mind seems to figure it all out. I'm not saying you shouldn't trust your instinct, listen to it but don't act so fast, your friend might still be telling her misfortune, you owe that friend you full attention in listening.


## Asking the right question.
