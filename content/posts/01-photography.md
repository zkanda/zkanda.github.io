What is Photography?

It is my personal definition, it is my therapy. A way of seeing things in different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, to remember, my father recently passed away and seeing his photos takes me back to a lot of good memories we shared together.

When I meet someone that do the same thing, I asked them, "Why do you do photography?", there so many answers, some doesn't even have an answer, there's a lot about money, fame and social attention, I'm totally fine with any of those but I'm drawn to a particular one, those who do it because of their own deep personal reasons.

Now, I won't lie, I do have ambition and I'd like my work to be seen by the world, but for now, it's the first reason why I do it.

> I try with my pictures to raise a question, to provoke a debate, so that we can discuss problems together and come up with solutions.

That quotation is from a famous person namely *Sebasti√£o Salgado*, he is a social documentary photographer and his work is so phenomenal and heartbreaking. Nonetheless, he do it because he has a wild purpose.

To end this, I'd like to ask you the same question, why do you do photography?
