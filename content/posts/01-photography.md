What is Photography?

It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, my father recently passed away and saw his photos take me back to a lot of good memories we shared.

When I meet someone that does the same thing, I asked them, “Why do you do photography?”. There so many answers. Some don’t even have an answer. I hear about money(bills), fame, and social attention. I’m okay with any of those, but I’m drawn to a particular one, those who do it because of their own deeply personal reasons. I won’t lie, I do have ambition, and I’d like my work to be seen by the world, but time will tell if that works out. For now, I’ll pay attention to the present moment and fire my camera’s shutter.

> I try with my pictures to raise a question, to provoke a debate, so that we can discuss problems together and come up with solutions.

That quotation is from a famous photographer, namely Sebastião Salgado, he does many social documentary photos, and his work is phenomenal and heartbreaking. Nonetheless, he does it because he has a wild purpose.
To end this, I’d like to ask you the same question, why do you do photography?
