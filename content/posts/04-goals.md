I'm currently in a position where I have so many things I'd like to do.

Some shortlist.

* Photography
    - Portraiture - whenever I meet someone that I'm interested in.
    - Nature - when I'm with mother nature.
    - Street Photography - whenever I'm in a city where it's appropriate.
* Short Film Documentary
* Software Development
* Surfing
* Strength Training

In no particular order and that's probably a lot of things already.
But well, I may not be an expert on any, but I enjoy it, so yeah, fuck it, I'm going to try learning these things.

Philosophy in learning?

Brute force.
That's precisely my framework of learning.
I got no schedule, got no pressure, and it's whenever I feel like it.
I acknowledge that it's not a suitable method.
However, as long as I know why I like doing that thing, I will do it, no excuses.
