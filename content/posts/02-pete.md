Pete is his name. He's the first person I asked if it's okay to take a photo of him. I'm glad said, "yes."

Behind those fearless eyes is a gentle person with a lot of hard-earned experiences.

He used to be a nurse in London.

One day, he decided to leave the city for various reasons, but one of those is that he couldn't get any help that he needed.

It took him "10 minutes" to do everything, and he's out of his previous apartment.

Now he's in Phuket volunteering to take care of dogs shelter.
