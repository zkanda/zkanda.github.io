Pete is his name, he's the first person I asked if it's okay to take a photo of him, I'm glad said "yes".

Behind those fearless eyes are a gentle man.
He used to be a nurse in London.

But decided one day to just pack his bag and go to a place near the beach. It took him "10 minutes" to do everything and he's out of his old apartment.
