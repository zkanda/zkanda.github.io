Today is the 3rd month when I joined a photographers online meetup. I was invited by my colleauge.

My posting in instagram have been erratic.

Sometimes, I feel the need to update, other times, my creative output is just soaring.

Lately though, been feeling lost about this particular activity.

I've not been fulfeeling that creative satisfaction, perhaps even validation that social media gives, the likes that I recieve.

I'm inspired by one photographer, her photos seem free. Although there's a recurring theme, in my perspective, it's not holding her back.
