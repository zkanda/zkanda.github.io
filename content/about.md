Hey there! I hope you're having a good day. My name is Zakatell and thank you for visiting my little corner on the internet.

If you stumbled here, then you probably found my post intriguing or wanna know me a little. Here are some small details:

* A software developer currently working for [engageSPARK](https://www.engagespark.com). It's a fantastic company with awesome people, come [join us](https://www.engagespark.com/careers).
* Photography as a hobby.
* Reading books, from novels to self-help.

If you're still reading then I'm more interested in you, hit me up an email: hi at zkanda.io, let's get some coffee maybe?

Cheers!
