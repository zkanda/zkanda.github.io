Hey there! I hope you're having a good day. My name is Zakatell and thank you for visiting my site.

If you stumbled here then you probably found my post intriguing or wanna know me a little. Here are some small details:

* A software developer currently working for [engageSPARK](https://www.engagespark.com). It's an amazing company with awesome people, come [join us](https://www.engagespark.com/careers).
* Photography as a hobby.
* Reading books, from novels to self-help.

If you're still reading then I'm more interested in you, hit me up an email: hi at zkanda.io, let's get some coffee maybe?

Cheers!
