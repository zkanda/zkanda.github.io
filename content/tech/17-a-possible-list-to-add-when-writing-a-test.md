When writing test, the documentation that the API your integrating into only list all the good values that they intend to deliver to you or the other way around.

What I observed from working with my colleague Harmen is this:

- A negative test
- A positive test for happy path
- An empty input
- A malformed data

I might add more example in the future but for now, I'll try to follow this guideline.
