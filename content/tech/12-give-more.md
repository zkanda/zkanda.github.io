I'm currently reading a book called Give and Take, it made me realize the value of sharing on my blog and in everyday life, I hope to write more about things that I can give value to others as well as a constant reminder of things that have given me lots of "Aha" moments in my career as a Software Developer.

I really like the quote inside a quote in the book:

> "As Samuel Johnson purportedly wrote, "The true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him absolutely no good."

Anyone that needs any help from me can email me directly: hi at zkanda.io
