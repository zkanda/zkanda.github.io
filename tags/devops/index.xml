So in our team, we had to resize an instance disk because it&amp;rsquo;s getting full, this is our experience.
For the first time we search on how to do this, there are many articles written about it and most of them require to stop the system and detaching a volume. But there must be a real doc from aws itself, that is most likely up to date.</description></item><item><title>disabling udp in memcached.</title><link>https://zkanda.io/src/disabling-udp-in-memcached/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 18:54:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zkanda.io/src/disabling-udp-in-memcached/</guid><description>One of our server provider which is running in Germany have a bot that scans for an open port, this is to prevent other humans/robot in abusing services that are open on the internet.
For us, they determined that our memcached port is open, we were confused at first how could this happen, we were sure that this is blocked via iptables.
It turns out memcached by default listens to both TCP and UDP, since we don&amp;rsquo;t have yet a firewall for UDP, we opted for something simpler and to disable UDP on memcached(we know we only use TCP).</description></item></channel></rss>
