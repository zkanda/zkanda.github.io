      <description>So I upgraded my Windows software to the latest insider preview and it kind of messed up my laptop.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the error message:
EFI stub: ERROR: failed to read file. Trying to load files to higher address EFI stub: ERROR: failed to read file.  Here&amp;rsquo;s the step I did to resolved it.
 Boot in an ArchLinux liveusb. Mount your root and boot partition. Chroot into it. And reinstall the bootloader.</description>

      <description>You have a new laptop, you install ArchLinux on it and seems like a some things is missing. Certainly this is the case for me, one of this is suspend feature, when doing, my laptop just seems to boot as if I shutdown it, my application is not persisted. Another is a fix for my headphone noise issue, just to name a few.
 Some things is missing!
 One of the few things you can try is to install the latest beta kernel.</description>
