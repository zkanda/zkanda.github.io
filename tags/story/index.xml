Her alpha-like attitude and knowledge doesn&amp;rsquo;t speak of her age, and bargaining skills are next to nothing.
She&amp;rsquo;s an adventurer at heart, but most of all, she can easily talk to anyone, and you can tell she&amp;rsquo;s listening.</description></item><item><title>Pete</title><link>https://zkanda.io/posts/02-pete/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Aug 2019 22:59:30 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://zkanda.io/posts/02-pete/</guid><description>Pete is his name. He&amp;rsquo;s the first person I asked if it&amp;rsquo;s okay to take a photo of him. I&amp;rsquo;m glad he said, &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
He used to be a nurse in London.
