      <description>Increasing disk space without downtime.
So in our team, we had to resize an instance disk because it&amp;rsquo;s getting full, this is our experience.
For the first time we search on how to do this, there&amp;rsquo;s many article written about it and most of them requires to stop the system and detaching a volume. But there must be a real docs from aws itself, that is most likely up to date.</description>

      <description>At work, we started using Kubernetes for stateless application. We frequently change the values of configmap/secrets especially in staging environments, however, this is still not baked in to k8s.

You have to replaced a config to update it.
For example, if you create a configmap like this:
kubectl create configmap site-config --from-file=nginx.conf  If you want to update that, you have to add the command above with</description>
