      <description>Increasing disk space without downtime.
So in our team, we had to resize an instance disk because it&amp;rsquo;s getting full, this is our experience.
For the first time we search on how to do this, there are many articles written about it and most of them require to stop the system and detaching a volume. But there must be a real doc from aws itself, that is most likely up to date.</description>

      <description>At work, we started using Kubernetes for stateless application. We frequently change the values of configmap/secrets especially in staging environments, however, this is still not baked in to k8s.

For example, if you create a configmap like this:
