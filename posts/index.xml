      <description>What is Photography?
It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, to remember, my father recently passed away and seeing his photos takes me back to a lot of good memories we shared.
When I meet someone that does the same thing, I asked them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you do photography?</description>
