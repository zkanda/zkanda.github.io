      <description>What is Photography?
It is my personal definition, it is my therapy. A way of seeing things in different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, to remember, my father recently passed away and seeing his photos takes me back to a lot of good memories we shared together.
When I meet someone that do the same thing, I asked them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you do photography?</description>
