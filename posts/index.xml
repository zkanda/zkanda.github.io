      <description>Pete is his name. He&amp;rsquo;s the first person I asked if it&amp;rsquo;s okay to take a photo of him. I&amp;rsquo;m glad said, &amp;ldquo;yes.&amp;rdquo;
Behind those fearless eyes is a gentle person with a lot of hard-earned experiences.
He used to be a nurse in London.
One day, he decided to leave the city for various reasons, but one of those is that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any help that he needed.</description>

      <description>What is Photography?
It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, to remember, my father recently passed away and seeing his photos takes me back to a lot of good memories we shared.
When I meet someone that does the same thing, I asked them, &amp;ldquo;Why do you do photography?</description>
