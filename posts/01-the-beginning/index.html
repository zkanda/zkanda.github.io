    <p>What does it take to be inspired? To feel connected with what you&rsquo;re doing?</p>

<p>This is what photography is for me, or maybe more than that.</p>

<p>There was a time where I worked a lot, not smartly but hardly. It was a moment of happiness, a state of flow. But at some
point, I felt like this was the only thing that&rsquo;s happening in my life, it was fun, but I couldn&rsquo;t get out the feeling
of uneasiness, an intuition of doing something. I tried many things, and in a way, photography is the one that clicked.
The act of taking photo satisfies my other curiosity. Maybe you could call it my desire for art, but in a way, my professional
work is, in my opinion, is a form of art too. In any case, doing photography and programming is very beneficial for me.</p>

<p>What I was thinking is to add some sort of stories between photos. But it might be something else.</p>

<p>The goal would be to showcase, tell a story and become a source of inspiration.</p>
