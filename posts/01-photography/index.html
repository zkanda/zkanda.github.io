It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted.

There so many answers, some doesn&rsquo;t even have an answer, I hear about money(bills), fame, and social attention. I&rsquo;m fine with any of those, but I&rsquo;m drawn to a particular one, those who do it because of their own deeply personal reasons. I won&rsquo;t lie, I do have ambition, and I&rsquo;d like my work to be seen by the world, but time will tell if that works out. For now, I&rsquo;ll pay attention to the present moment and fire my camera&rsquo;s shutter.</p><blockquote><p>I try with my pictures to raise a question, to provoke a debate, so that we can discuss problems together and come up with solutions.</p></blockquote><p>That quotation is from a famous photographer, namely <em>Sebasti√£o Salgado</em>, he do a lot of social documentary photos, and his work is phenomenal and heartbreaking.
