It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted.

    <p>What is Photography?</p>

<p>It is my definition, and it is my therapy. A way of seeing things from a different perspective, it requires me to be observant and be in the moment to catch those simple things in life that I usually took for granted. Lastly, to remember, my father recently passed away and seeing his photos takes me back to a lot of good memories we shared.</p>

<p>When I meet someone that does the same thing, I asked them, &ldquo;Why do you do photography?&rdquo;. There so many answers, some doesn&rsquo;t even have an answer, I hear about money(bills), fame, and social attention. I&rsquo;m fine with any of those, but I&rsquo;m drawn to a particular one, those who do it because of their own deeply personal reasons. I won&rsquo;t lie, I do have ambition, and I&rsquo;d like my work to be seen by the world, but time will tell if that works out. For now, I&rsquo;ll pay attention to the present moment and fire my camera&rsquo;s shutter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I try with my pictures to raise a question, to provoke a debate, so that we can discuss problems together and come up with solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That quotation is from a famous photographer, namely <em>Sebasti√£o Salgado</em>, he do a lot of social documentary photos, and his work is phenomenal and heartbreaking. Nonetheless, he does it because he has a wild purpose.</p>

<p>To end this, I&rsquo;d like to ask you the same question, why do you do photography?</p>
