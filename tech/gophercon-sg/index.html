                <p>This is the first time attending a conference outside my country. It was pretty exciting and scary because I&rsquo;m going alone but nonetheless it was an amazing experience.</p>

<p>I met a couple of interesting people and mostly I think it boosts more my confidence in traveling.</p>

<p>The <strong>first day</strong> was all about learning Go for Intermediate developers by <a href="https://www.goinggo.net/">William Kennedy.</a></p>

<p><img src="/content/images/2017/05/GopherConSG---First-Day-Training.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I learned quite a lot, although I&rsquo;ve been using Go in work for some time now, I admit that I still have a long way to go. The core that I have to learn more is how to effectively use <code>interface</code>. I was awed when he showed the tooling on profiling a Go <a href="https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/topics/go/profiling/memcpu">code</a>, I&rsquo;m looking forward on his blog post diving deeper on these subject.</p>

<p>On the <strong>second day</strong> is where I got to see a lot of speakers, talked to some interesting people, and of course, I met one of the creators of Go <a href="https://research.google.com/pubs/author96.html">Robert Griesemer</a>.</p>

it&rsquo;s worth paying its price.

</blockquote>

<p>Personally, the talks that interest me are this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2557w0qsDV0&amp;list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&amp;index=3">Escape Analysis and Memory Profiling</a> - I saw this on the lecture and still very interesting to see again.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttmzQbaYjjk&amp;list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&amp;index=6">Distributed Scheduler Hell</a> - talk about the caveats of using new deployment platforms like mesos and kubernetes, and what are the things they are still not good at.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg&amp;list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&amp;index=10">TDD for those who don&rsquo;t need it</a> -  A very nice talk, at first I would almost think this the speaker hates TDD, but he presented in a way that a lot of people can relate. Think of the test as a set of requirements, one small task at a time and getting things done.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmARDfv6VN8&amp;index=7&amp;list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8">Native Go Development on GCP with the Context Package</a> - this one was a short talk but gave a very brief overview of why <code>context</code> package is needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2A80PfYww&amp;list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&amp;index=8">Distributed Tracing in Grab</a> - Talk about opentracing and how useful it is when you have microservices, this is tied somehow with <code>context</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the talk, there was an after party which is near the conference area. Lot&rsquo;s of food and drinks, here I was able to talk with Robert, I&rsquo;m surprised by how humble he is. We talk quite a lot, I even asked him what prompted them to develop go. I can&rsquo;t exactly remember the exact word but he told me that Ken Thompson was trying to compile C++ code and he got frustrated, so Robert told him they have to fix it. That where it started, back in 2007. In the end, I asked him for some advice and he told me this book called <a href="https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction/index.html">Compiler Construction</a>. Well I guess have some new stuff to read.</p>

<p>And mostly thanks to the organizers of <a href="https://2017.gophercon.sg/">GopherConSG</a>, you guys did an absolutely amazing event.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for some post about these subjects.</p>
