          <p>Increasing disk space without downtime.</p>

<p>So in our team, we had to resize an instance disk because it&rsquo;s getting full, this is our experience.</p>

<p>For the first time we search on how to do this, there&rsquo;s many article written about it and most of them requires to stop the system and detaching a volume. But there must be a real docs from aws itself, that is most likely up to date.</p>

<p>After more searching, we found this link: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-modify-volume.html</a></p>

<p>From there, it seems like we can modify it on the fly since our instance is current generation, so that&rsquo;s good news.</p>

<p>Since we mount the whole volume, we didn&rsquo;t need to extend a partition table. You only have to use the <code>resize</code> command.</p>

<p>The list of block devices attached to our instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ lsblk -f
NAME    FSTYPE LABEL           UUID                                 MOUNTPOINT
xvda
└─xvda1 ext4   cloudimg-rootfs b6adc449-5e3d-4331-ba6b-xxxx /
xvdb    ext4                   85a58c7a-d914-4b85-be3c-xxxx /opt/
</code></pre>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the resize command.</p>

<pre><code class="language-sh">$ sudo resize2fs /dev/xvdb
resize2fs 1.42.13 (17-May-2015)
Filesystem at /dev/xvdb is mounted on /opt/couchdb; on-line resizing required
old_desc_blocks = 4, new_desc_blocks = 10
The filesystem on /dev/xvdb is now 39321600 (4k) blocks long.
</code></pre>

<p>This was very nice and smooth experience and we are glad for this functionality, thank you AWS team and whoever made this possible.</p>
