    First Time Street Photography: PhotoWalk in Cebu

<p>This was a first time experience and somehow it is easier said than done. Getting creative shots on the street is not an easy task.</p>

<p>Me and a friend decided to met up in a coffee shop first where they have this unique interior.</p>

<p><img src="https://zkanda.github.io/images/2018/04/_DSF0936.jpg" alt="_DSF0936" /></p>

<p>The meeting place for the Photowalk is at Magellan&rsquo;s Cross at 11am, it was quite late, so if you&rsquo;re in the place where it&rsquo;s hot and humid, pack lightly and use breathable clothes.</p>

<p>One thing that stood out was how intense the light from the sun. It was so bright that taking a shot with shadows is hard, so what I did was to underexposed the shot because it&rsquo;s easier to recover dark image in post process using Adobe Lightroom but still very limited to what I can do.</p>

<h3 id="various-shots">Various shots</h3>

<p>Assorted photos that came out quite okay.</p>

<p>Street food is quite common&hellip;

<p>Random church doors, those plants show how this is unused for some time.

<p>Abandoned car? We are not sure. What do you think?

<p>The lighting here is adorable.

<p>We asked the guy who is touring us inside the place if we could ride the bike&hellip;.. guess what he said.

<p>We entered a museum and the first thing that caught our eye is this dog peacefully sleeping in the corner.

<p>Found this almost neatly piled squash, literally running because our group was walking a bit faster during this time.

<p>Thanks to the people I&rsquo;ve been with during the Photowalk session, it was really fun, tiring and quite a learning experience. Especially to Danica who organize the event. Check out her blog <a href="https://danicatanjutco.wordpress.com/">here.</a></p>

<p>Another huge thanks to Jeanne and Victoire for reviewing this article.</p>

<p>All of this was shot using Fuji X-E3 with XF23mmF2 lens.</p>
