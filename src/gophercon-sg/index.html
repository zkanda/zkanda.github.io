It was pretty exciting and scary because I&rsquo;m going alone but nonetheless it was an amazing experience.</p><p>I met a couple of interesting people and mostly I think it boosts more my confidence in traveling.</p><p>The <strong>first day</strong> was all about learning Go for Intermediate developers by <a href=https://www.goinggo.net/>William Kennedy.</a></p><p><img src=/content/images/2017/05/GopherConSG---First-Day-Training.jpg alt></p><p>I learned quite a lot, although I&rsquo;ve been using Go in work for some time now, I admit that I still have a long way to go. The core that I have to learn more is how to effectively use <code>interface</code>. I was awed when he showed the tooling on profiling a Go <a href=https://github.com/ardanlabs/gotraining/tree/master/topics/go/profiling/memcpu>code</a>, I&rsquo;m looking forward on his blog post diving deeper on these subject.</p><p>On the <strong>second day</strong> is where I got to see a lot of speakers, talked to some interesting people, and of course, I met one of the creators of Go <a href=https://research.google.com/pubs/author96.html>Robert Griesemer</a>.</p><p><img src=/content/images/2017/05/exporting-go-robert-keynote.jpg alt></p><blockquote><p>If the abstraction is right,
it&rsquo;s worth paying its price.</p><ul><li>Robert Griesemer</li></ul></blockquote><p>Personally, the talks that interest me are this:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2557w0qsDV0&list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&index=3">Escape Analysis and Memory Profiling</a> - I saw this on the lecture and still very interesting to see again.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttmzQbaYjjk&list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&index=6">Distributed Scheduler Hell</a> - talk about the caveats of using new deployment platforms like mesos and kubernetes, and what are the things they are still not good at.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a6oP24CSdUg&list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&index=10">TDD for those who don&rsquo;t need it</a> - A very nice talk, at first I would almost think this the speaker hates TDD, but he presented in a way that a lot of people can relate. Think of the test as a set of requirements, one small task at a time and getting things done.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmARDfv6VN8&index=7&list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8">Native Go Development on GCP with the Context Package</a> - this one was a short talk but gave a very brief overview of why <code>context</code> package is needed.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm2A80PfYww&list=PLq2Nv-Sh8EbZEjZdPLaQt1qh_ohZFMDj8&index=8">Distributed Tracing in Grab</a> - Talk about opentracing and how useful it is when you have microservices, this is tied somehow with <code>context</code>.</li></ul><p>After the talk, there was an after party which is near the conference area. Lot&rsquo;s of food and drinks, here I was able to talk with Robert, I&rsquo;m surprised by how humble he is. We talk quite a lot, I even asked him what prompted them to develop go. I can&rsquo;t exactly remember the exact word but he told me that Ken Thompson was trying to compile C++ code and he got frustrated, so Robert told him they have to fix it. That where it started, back in 2007. In the end, I asked him for some advice and he told me this book called <a href=https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction/index.html>Compiler Construction</a>. Well I guess have some new stuff to read.</p><p>And mostly thanks to the organizers of <a href=https://2017.gophercon.sg/>GopherConSG</a>, you guys did an absolutely amazing event.</p><p>Stay tuned for some post about these subjects.</p><p>Edit 1: Updated with links to include Youtube videos.</p></article><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/posts>posts</a>
