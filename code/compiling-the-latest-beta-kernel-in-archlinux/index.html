                <p>You have a new laptop, you install ArchLinux on it and seems like a some things is missing. Certainly this is the case for me, one of this is suspend feature, when doing, my laptop just seems to boot as if I shutdown it, my application is not persisted. Another is a fix for my headphone noise issue, just to name a few.</p>

<p>One of the few things you can try is to install the latest beta kernel. In my case it&rsquo;s Linux 4.6. This fix all of the issued I outlined above.</p>

<p>With that said, you need to err on the side of caution, this can make your computer not boot, so please have an CD/Flash drive to boot from in case something is wrong so you can revert back.</p>

<p>All of these process is actually not so bad, so what do you need first.</p>

<ol>
<li>Get the package build: <code>git clone --depth 1 git://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git linux-packages</code></li>
<li><code>cd linux-packages/linux/trunk</code></li>
<li><code>makepkg -s</code> - This will take some time, so get you coffee or do something to make use of your time.</li>
<li><code>pacman -U *.pkg.tar</code></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>Reboot your system and voila.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is also <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-mainline/">linux-mainline aur</a> to automatically do it for you. However at the time of the writing, it&rsquo;s already on <code>4.7rc1</code> and it&rsquo;s really bleeding edge and <code>4.6</code> seems to be enough for now.</p>
