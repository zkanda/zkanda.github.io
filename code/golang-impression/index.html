<p>I&rsquo;ve been very excited to use Go at work and somehow very refreshing, been meaning to learn it for some time but it&rsquo;s more easier for me to learn if I actually see it in action.</p>

<p>So far it&rsquo;s been very nice, though of course some stuff are not so easy. Here&rsquo;s one trivial matter.</p>

<ul>
<li>First using it with Python feel like I&rsquo;m lost when context switching. Our main application is written in Python/Django and we are slowly trying to build microservices around it. They communicate via thrift.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had to test a package that make sure it truncates to a certain unicode character limit. This is when I appreciated Python for having duck typing. I can just build a long character like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">long_unicode_char = &quot;ひ&quot; * 100
</code></pre>

<p>For some reason, my brain us fixated on how easy it is to do in dynamic language that it blocks from trying to search for a way in Go. But then of course, after some complaining and brain rewire you can then move forward.</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s how you should it.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">s := strings.Repeat(&quot;ひ&quot;, 100)
</code></pre>

<p>Small things matters.</p>

<h4 id="contributing">Contributing</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tried contributing to the ecosystem, so far I&rsquo;m interested on <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">dep</a>, the new and hopefully will become the official package management. The people who manage it seems to be very nice. And for some interesting reason, it&rsquo;s one of the project that have active woman contributors, I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a lot, but it&rsquo;s kind of just refreshing thought.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="glaring-dislike">Glaring dislike</h4>

<ul>
<li>One inherit things that I don&rsquo;t like is how common it is to declare single character variable, you see this a lot in examples given even in the official blog post. I see this mostly in c code but I guess I just have to get used to that.</li>
</ul>
